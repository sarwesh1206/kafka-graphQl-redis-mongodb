Streams are collections of data — just like arrays or strings. The difference is that streams might not be available all at once, and they don’t have to fit in memory. 
#here are four fundamental stream types in Node.js: Readable, Writable, Duplex, and Transform streams.

#A duplex streams is both Readable and Writable. An example of that is a TCP socket.
#A transform stream is basically a duplex stream that can be used to modify or transform the data as it is written and read. An example of that is the zlib.createGzip stream to compress the data using gzip. 

#All streams are instances of EventEmitter. They emit events that can be used to read and write data. However, we can consume streams data in a simpler way using the pipe method.
